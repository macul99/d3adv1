This is a simple graph demonstrating the addition of tooltips with a graph. This was written using d3.js v4 and is a follow on to the simple scatter plot example [here](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/2505b09d0feb51d0c9873cc486f10f67). 

This graph is part of the code samples for the update to the book [D3 Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v4) to version 4 of d3.js.
